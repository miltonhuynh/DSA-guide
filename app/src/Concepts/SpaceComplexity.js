        <div>Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. </div><br/>
        <div>When an algorithm is run on a computer, it necessitates a certain amount of memory space. The amount of memory used by a program to execute it is represented by its space complexity. Because a program requires memory to store input data and temporal values while running, the space complexity is auxiliary and input space.</div><br/>
        <div>Space complexity depends on a variety of things such as the programming language, the compiler, or even the machine running the algorithm</div><br/>
